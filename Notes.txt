########################## Getting Started ##########################

--> django-admin: This command will give the other available commands.
--> To create a new project: django-admin startproject django-project
This will create below folders/files,
manage.py	==> This is how our web applicaion can be used through command line interface.
__init__.py	==> This is the empty file, used for python identifying it as a python package.
settings.py	==> This file contains all the config settings such as apps, debug, DB,security key, etc.
urls.py		==> This file contains the url mapping of the website.
wsgi.py		==> Web application and web server communicates through this file.
asgi.py		==> 
--> To start the server, python manage.py runserver. The server will be up & application will be available in 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000.
--> By default, the admin page is configured in django & can be accessed through localhost:8000/admin. But there is no default credentials & it should be configured.

########################## Applications and Routes ##########################

--> To create a app: python manage.py startapp blog
--> urls.py file needs to be created within the app folder (This will not be created by default). 
--> To create the simple web page, the logic is,
User --> project url --> app url -->views.py
--> In views.py file, the HttpResponse has to be imported from dango.http & the function should accept request & return http response.
--> In app urls.py file,  1)url as string 2) module.function_name it has to be referred 3) any unique name
--> In project urls.py file, the include function has to be imported from django.urls & the url matching shoulg go to include function (app url in string)
--> It is always better to use trailing slash in urls.
